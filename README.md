### Project Description

Slipper Alignment Alert is a fun yet functional innovation designed to keep your slippers perfectly aligned, every single time. With a smart sensing system, it detects when slippers are placed unevenly and gently alerts the user, ensuring a neat and organized look. Not only does it add a touch of convenience to daily life, but it also encourages tidiness and prevents those small but annoying moments of searching for the "right foot slipper." This project blends simple technology with everyday living, proving that even the tiniest problems can inspire creative solutions.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People waste precious seconds (or even minutes!) every day struggling to find the right slipper because their slippers are never perfectly aligned. This leads to mild frustration, random slipper mismatches, and an overall untidy floor. It‚Äôs a small, silly problem ‚Äî but hey, who wants that hassle before starting the day?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a smart slipper whisperer! Using a clever sensing system, it checks if your slippers are perfectly lined up and gently nudges you if they‚Äôre not. No more mismatched feet or awkward shuffles ‚Äî just perfectly aligned slippers ready to step out in style. Because life‚Äôs too short for confused slippers!
